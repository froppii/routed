# Frontend environment variables for Vite
# Set the backend base URL used for API requests.
# Example for your deployed instance:
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://routed.froppii.hackclub.app

# For local development you can either leave this unset (the app falls back to http://localhost:46039)
# or set it to your local backend if it's running on a different host/port.
# VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:46039
